                According to all known laws
                of aviation,
                there is no way a bee
                should be able to fly.
                Its wings are too small to get
                its fat little body off the ground.
                The bee, of course, flies anyway
                because bees don't care
                what humans think is impossible.
                Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                Ooh, black and yellow!
                Let's shake it up a little.
                Barry! Breakfast is ready!
                Ooming!
                Hang on a second.
                Hello?
                - Barry?
                - Adam?
                - Oan you believe this is happening?
                - I can't. I'll pick you up.

                Use the stairs. Your father
                paid good money for those.
                Sorry. I'm excited.
                Here's the graduate.
                We're very proud of you, son.</p>
